# Xamarin Themes
This Xamarin.Forms example demonstrates app themes!

We'll show you how to manually select app themes and automatically switch to dark theme based on system settings using Xamarin.Forms.

Good news is coming soon! Though this feature is not apart of Xamarin.Essentials (v1.3), it should be available in v1.4 according to [Pull Request 923](https://github.com/xamarin/Essentials/issues/923) and [Enhancement 923](https://github.com/xamarin/Essentials/issues/923).
