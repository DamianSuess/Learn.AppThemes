### Good news coming soon!
Though this feature is not apart of Xamarin.Essentials (v1.3), it should be available in v1.4 according to [Pull Request 923](https://github.com/xamarin/Essentials/issues/923) and [Enhancement 923](https://github.com/xamarin/Essentials/issues/923).

Normally, I just piecemeal parts of my larger projects but since Xamarin.Essentials is offering this feature soon, I'll try and use their naming conventions so the transition is smoother!

## Themes
* 1 - Graphite-Lite
* 1 - One-Dark
* 4 - Material-Dark - only use the blue links for ``One-Dark``

## Sample Colors

### Dark Theme
| Name    | Hex     | Color|
|---------|---------|------|
| BGColor | #282c34 |  |
| Links   | #409eff |  |
| Text    |         |  |
